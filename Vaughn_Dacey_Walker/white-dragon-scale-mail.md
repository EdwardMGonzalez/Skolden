# White Dragon Scale Mail
__Cold Resistance__

__AC:__ 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) + 1 bonus
__Weight:__ 45lb
__Stealth:__ Disadvantage

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against 
the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type 
that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction 
to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action 
canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
