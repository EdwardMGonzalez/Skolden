## From last session:

Everyone gets 7 gold
Ilda (Mel) gets 6g 10s

## Recap:

We were asked to travel to Laufi's farm, because of a persistent wolf attack.
We investigated and tracked the wolves to an abandoned estate and we did some
investigating there. We found a note in the house (see email) and a discarded
pile of clothing, the rotting remains of a male human (dead 3 weeks).

We battled the werewolf and killed its pet, a winter wolf. The werewolf
ran off into the woods in mortal pain.


##

After a short rest we head out to track the wolf. It's easy to chase as
there is a trail of blood and hair leading off to the west. The tracks
end in a clearing. There's a motionless body of the wolf in front of
a cave.

Kal stealths over to the cave, but can see little and hears nothing.
The werewolf continues to rest in the clearing. Oblivious to Kal's
creepign.

As we approach the werewolf turns and scurries into the cave.
Vrondir casts a fireball which misses the wolf. Something snaps
and we all tumble downward into darkness.

Kal can see some handholds in the darkness.

Vaughn is critically wounded by the fall and passes out.

There are beams holding up the ceiling so it doesn't cave in.
There is a passageway heading east of of the chamber.

Ilva lights a torch and we can see the bones of what appear to be animals,
some have teeth marks.

Vrondir tends to Vaughns wounds as a hissing sort of languge comes down the hall.

The team attempts to hide from whatever is making those noises. 4 folk come into
the room and Rat lunges at them.

Battle ensues with Kobolds. Rat tears through them.

Rat shouts at the kobold "Where's the werewolf?"
The kobold shouts for mercy. No one pays attention to her and she runs off.

We chase the kobold down a winding passage through the cave. Eventualy we see
light in the darkness.

Rat binds the kobold.

Vrondir stealths up to where the light is coming from. There's a large fire
in the middle, with a questionable hunk of meat roasting. It smells awesome

There was a crude wooden chair, something of a throne in the cave.

4 kobolds have daggers, slings, and 15 stones total.

Kal stealths in a bit and waves us into the room w/light. he also reports back
that the werewolf fell to its death with us.

There's a pile of gems, with some plain bits of jewelry in the large chamber.

Kal scouts a head as we head up and out of this large room. There were 8
sleeping pallets in the room, which might imply we've only seen about
half of this cave's inhabitats.

The smell of rotting meat is strong in this cavern. 4 iron chains can
be seen from a pit and they're moving around. THere are dessicated
claws, scraping at the edge of a pit that was constructed in the room.

Thor ties a rope to the hunk or roasting meat and throws it into the
pit with dessicated hands. Out of the pit comes four humaniods that look
like un-dead, dried bodies with large tongues. They reek of rot and disease.

Battle ensues

Ilva is paralyzed by a hit from one of these un-dead critters.

Rat hops into the pit after the gouls were vanquished and pops
out of the pitt with a bright red cloak on.
