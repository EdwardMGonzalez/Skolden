## From last session:

Everyone gets 7 gold
Ilda (Mel) gets 6g 10s

## Recap:

We were asked to travel to Laufi's farm, because of a persistent wolf attack.
We investigated and tracked the wolves to an abandoned estate and we did some
investigating there. We found a note in the house (see email) and a discarded
pile of clothing, the rotting remains of a male human (dead 3 weeks).

We battled the werewolf and killed its pet, a winter wolf. The werewolf
ran off into the woods in mortal pain.


##

After a short rest we head out to track the wolf. It's easy to chase as
there is a trail of blood and hair leading off to the west. The tracks
end in a clearing. There's a motionless body of the wolf in front of
a cave.

Kal stealths over to the cave, but can see little and hears nothing.
The werewolf continues to rest in the clearing. Oblivious to Kal's
creepign.

As we approach the werewolf turns and scurries into the cave.
Vrondir casts a fireball which misses the wolf. Something snaps
and we all tumble downward into darkness.

Kal can see some handholds in the darkness.

Vaughn is critically wounded by the fall and passes out.

There are beams holding up the ceiling so it doesn't cave in.
There is a passageway heading east of of the chamber.

Ilva lights a torch and we can see the bones of what appear to be animals,
some have teeth marks.

Vrondir tends to Vaughns wounds as a hissing sort of languge comes down the hall.

The team attempts to hide from whatever is making those noises. 4 folk come into
the room and Rat lunges at them.

Battle ensues with Kobolds. Rat tears through them.

Rat shouts at the kobold "Where's the werewolf?"
The kobold shouts for mercy. No one pays attention to her and she runs off.

We chase the kobold down a winding passage through the cave. Eventualy we see
light in the darkness.

Rat binds the kobold.

Vrondir stealths up to where the light is coming from. There's a large fire
in the middle, with a questionable hunk of meat roasting. It smells awesome

There was a crude wooden chair, something of a throne in the cave.

4 kobolds have daggers, slings, and 15 stones total.

Kal stealths in a bit and waves us into the room w/light. he also reports back
that the werewolf fell to its death with us.

There's a pile of gems, with some plain bits of jewelry in the large chamber.

Kal scouts a head as we head up and out of this large room. There were 8
sleeping pallets in the room, which might imply we've only seen about
half of this cave's inhabitats.

The smell of rotting meat is strong in this cavern. 4 iron chains can
be seen from a pit and they're moving around. THere are dessicated
claws, scraping at the edge of a pit that was constructed in the room.

Thor ties a rope to the hunk or roasting meat and throws it into the
pit with dessicated hands. Out of the pit comes four humaniods that look
like un-dead, dried bodies with large tongues. They reek of rot and disease.

Battle ensues

Ilva is paralyzed by a hit from one of these un-dead critters.

Rat hops into the pit after the gouls were vanquished and pops
out of the pitt with a bright red cloak on.

After a lengthy and dangerous battle, the group camps to recoup.

Clear a passage to the east and Kal & Rat sneak down into that passage.
As they move through it, they hear heavy breathing and see a large
reptile. It's the size of a school school bus. Its rythmic breathing
ceases and it lifts its head "I can smell you, you can come out".

Rat bribes this dragon (Ice Wing) with brandy. The dragon likes brandy!
He's allowed to leave on the condition that he brings brandy back within
a week. Rat & Kal negotiate for the group and we jet.

The group decides to check out Bolsong the Grey, to figure out
if he knows a way to take care of the dragon, perhaps by poison.

Return to Laufi's farm in the morning to let them know we've taken
care of the werewolf. Discuss the Girda house. Turns out they left before
the orc wars.

Laufi hands us a pounch of coins as reward for taking care of the wolves.

Gonna head back to the villiage and chat up Rorvald, to give him an idea
of status.

We stopped along the way to chat with Ilva's father he suggested we
talk to Dagni about wolves. We relay the fact that there could be
more werewolves in the area. We also let him know there's a dragon
in the area! yay.

Next: Rorvald, the city elder. He thanks us and throws us another sack
of gold. Greeg has already told Rorvald that we took care of the werewolves.
Rorvald invites us in and offers smoke and tea.

Laufi gave us each 15g, Rorvald gave us 25g each.

Volsung, Mr. Wizard dude, Dagni (Laufi's daughter) is 'prenticed to
Volsung. and she'll get in contact with him for us, so that we can
ask him some questions.

On the docks a young human male asks Kal if he needs assistance. Kal
gets some static from the kid. On the other side of the Solskin river
there's an abandoned keep and gate. There's a hulking elf (7' tall,
well muscled, but with a port-wine stain birthmark) approaches.

The elf comes up to the docks with a couple large war hounds and
he greets Kal. Kel explains the journey thus far and asks if he knows
of any poison we could use to kill the dragon.

If we had to mount a defense, he would come to the aid of Skolden and
fight the dragon.

Vrondir: Mother Zia is delighted by her approach and talks about some
herbs she needed to pick. She's a little dissapointed that we killed
the werewolf? She's pretty sure poisoning the dragon is a terrible
idea and no one has done it :)

We're woken up and told we need to come quickly. We go outside the inn
and there's a massive eagle with a woven basket strapped to its back.
Dagni is intisde the basket. Dagni invites us up into the basket.

Vrondir asks the Eagle for a feather, it's not happy about the
request.

We jump into the basket and the eagle flies us away for 30 mins
to the east. We land in a special spot on a 30+ foot tall tower.
Sanding in the landing area is an old man wiht a staff (Volsung).

The tower is built at odd angles with stairs and landing jutting out.

We ask for poison or weapons that could help...
He offered to enchant our weapons, so we can help slay the dragon.
The wizard flew us back to town adn took over the largest
room in the inn.

Ludo: Buy my things store. Ludo is a half orc "Greetings customers
welcome to 'Buy my Things'. How may I help you?"

Left off sorting out our plan
