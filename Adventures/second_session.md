# Second Session
_2016-08-20_

## Recap
Traveling to Skolden via wagon. Came upon some bodies and rescued a woman from undead in a cave.

Rescued town by going into a crypt and into a secret temple. Where people were worshipping
someone in a wolf motif.  The book of the Wolf was found there, we fought a wolf shapped
flesh creature.

## Days have passsed
Tori - bear having town guard
Harold - the clean shavin, town guard

We've been summoned to the Elder's cabin. Name: Rorvald

Mel's character and  her father (Greeg) come in. Her name is Ilva.

Laufi's farm had a wolf attack. That's no surprise, but Laufi's wife was also attacked.
Killed 3 sheep & a cow, but only recently started attacking people.

Group agree to head on out to the farm and investigate

## Next day

Bright morning, one of the clearer days. After we head out the horses pick
up a funky scent and begin acting funny. After a bit, they begin to spook.

The Druid notices that something is stalking us.

Two saber toothed tigers appear.
Rat, Ilva, Kal, and Thor all dig into the Tiger. Finally Ilva fells it.

Vrondir attempts to charm the other tiger. Vrondir succeeds and gets the
surviving tiger to run away. Brilliant.

We ride on after skinning and cleaning the dead tiger.

Meet up with Laufi and he tells the story of  how he and
Dagni drove wolves away from Bera, his wife. Dagni is an
apprentice to some local wizard ?? the Grey.

Wolf attack was 3 days ago. They killed 3 sheep last week.
Laufi is concerned about how long it will take him to replace them.

Rat: Where'd they go when you drove them off?

Laufi: They ran off to the South West (?). Rat heads out in that direction.

We head out and find evidence of the wolves passing. Some hair and paw prints
left. Not much, but enough to keep us tracking.

We continue on, Rat following the tracks on foot and Ilva guiding his horse.

More tracks, savaged deer.

Come to some old, ill worn buildings. Like an old estate in the woods.
There's a dilapidated barn.

Ilva recalls a story about an old house in the woods that belonged to an old
familiy. It was unual that anyone would live this far out.

The house was quite elaborate at one point, but it's in disrepair.

Rat looks into the house and begins shouting for inhabitants.

The barn has smells of offal and poop. Vrondir creeps up through the wood,
allowing Kal to sneak up. Twigs snap behind Vrondir and she sees several
sets of eyes behind her.

Encountered a warewolf on the roof of the barn. He ran into the house.
Inside is a green ratted banner with the paw of a bear on it.

Landing of the stairs, smashed mirror on the south wall.
Tapestry of a dude, wife, son, and large dog.

Ed: Wolves that attacked Laufi were likely controlled by warewolf.
Does this mean the warewolf has some history with Laufi?

Searched servents quarters found 25gp, 15sp, and a locket w/a child
inside that has icy blue eyes.

Child's room is relatively empty and abandoned.

North room on the left: Rotting remains of a male  human.
Scratches on the wall. The dead human has a necklace.

The dead guy if fur clad, but he's mauled beyond recognition.

found a travel pack: map, compass, rotted rations, folded up note:

Dearest brother, I hope this missive finds you... You'll have reach
Skolden before winter.  Your work there will go a long way to
freeing father from prison.

Map of the region: Indicates direction to Skolden from the north.

Under the bed: Liniage of the Girda family, a book. Girda were
old lords from this region, maybe 50-60 years ago. He abandoned
this estate years ago.

South room: Old dressing room.
Window in the south wall has been broken out.

Lars, boy from the journal.

A winter wolf, white and big as a house,
shows up after the warewolf calls.

Thor killed the Winter wolf.

Dining room:
Smashed tables & chairs, ruined books.

Skullery:
smashed plates, cups glasses, throughout.

Silver knives for everyone.

Kitchen:
discarded pots & pans, smashed clay containers

Sitting room:
destroyed furniture and painted frames

Library?:
couches & ruined books. 3 pieces of parchment, spells, scrolls.

Secret door in a desk.
Silver letter opener, pouch 15gp, rolled up parchment
Parchment is the deed to the estate. Yarl of Horstad.
Think it would hold up if challenged.
