# Second Session
_2016-08-20_

## Recap
Traveling to Skolden via wagon. Came upon some bodies and rescued a woman from undead in a cave.

Rescued town by going into a crypt and into a secret temple. Where people were worshipping
someone in a wolf motif.  The book of the Wolf was found there, we fought a wolf shapped
flesh creature.

## Days have passsed
Tori - bear having town guard
Harold - the clean shavin, town guard

We've been summoned to the Elder's cabin. Name: Rorvald

Mel's character and  her father (Greeg) come in. Her name is Ilva.

Laufi's farm had a wolf attack. That's no surprise, but Laufi's wife was also attacked.
Killed 3 sheep & a cow, but only recently started attacking people.

Group agree to head on out to the farm and investigate

## Next day

Bright morning, one of the clearer days. After we head out the horses pick
up a funky scent and begin acting funny. After a bit, they begin to spook.

The Druid notices that something is stalking us.

Two saber toothed tigers appear.
Rat, Ilva, Kal, and Thor all dig into the Tiger. Finally Ilva fells it.

Vrondir attempts to charm the other tiger. Vrondir succeeds and gets the
surviving tiger to run away. Brilliant.

We ride on after skinning and cleaning the dead tiger.

Meet up with Laufi and he tells the story of  how he and
Dagni drove wolves away from Bera, his wife. Dagni is an
apprentice to some local wizard ?? the Grey.

Wolf attack was 3 days ago. They killed 3 sheep last week.
Laufi is concerned about how long it will take him to replace them.

Rat: Where'd they go when you drove them off?
