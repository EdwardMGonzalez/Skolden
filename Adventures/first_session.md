# First Session

Travelling via wagon, with loose group of companions

Small girl's screams took us to the site of an ambush of travellers leaving Skolden.

Healed a dude (name?) by stemming wounds. Chased footprints of kobolds away from attack site.

We were onset by undead, the first sign of bad things to come.

Chased baddies into cave, found a femal (little girl's mom). We convinced her to head out after some fighting.

Made it to Skolden, met folks there at the Whitefish Inn.

Had no luck with Dalla the Smithy.

Were attacked by undead that evening, after Vaughn told stories at the Inn.

Chased them into a crypt, looks like worshippers of Fenrir. The wolves of Elverdalen are known to be huge and evil in this area

The crypt is an Isveg burial ground. The Isveg are known for warshipping Fenrir.

Fought through to find a book, Vaughn is translating.
