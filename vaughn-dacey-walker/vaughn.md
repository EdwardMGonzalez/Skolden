Past
----
Vaughn Dacey Walker is the child of Ake and Tori Walker. The family's trade is mostly in making sails. They also do some light cloth mending and leatherwork to supplement their income. Vaughn's elder siblings are Valencia, Freya, Den, Kari, Liv, and Ingmar. He has one younger brother, Aric. Being one of many kids he never felt like he had the attention he deserved.

A troop came through his hometown, Horstad, when he was younger and he fell in love with the idea of story telling. He practiced his craft on his younger brother Aric. He gathered stories of great battles and tales of heroism and deception from the sailors whose sails they repaired. And later he retold those stories with embellishments in the local tavern for a few coppers.

Years later when the troupe came back, he impressed the leader with a rough tale of bravery and trickery. "Boy, you heated my blood and moved my heart. I would have believed you'd done that, too, if I wasn't there when Gaetan fought off those wolves".  They agreed to take him in and that's where he met Ukaleq.

Ukaleq was an elderly woman who had an exceptional way with words. She introduced Vaughn to Bardic lore and showed him how words could do more than just evoke emotion. They could change reality.

Ukaleq had no children of her own and Vaughn finally found the attention that he craved. They performed in various towns traveling up and down the coast for a few years. Ukaleq eventually passed in her sleep and Vaughn decided a few months later to break out on his own. The troupe never really appreciated his talents.

Vaughn is now traveling to Skolden because he's heard tale about a smith there that used to be a mighty warrior. The smith lost his leg from the knee down and gave up battle for the forge. Vaughn will learn the smith's tales and add them to his arsenal.
